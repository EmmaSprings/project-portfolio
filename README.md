This weeks project was not as relaxing as I thought. To follow a design is doeable but there are a lot to check and make sure you have the right things in the right place. However I dp like Figma that way.

The most challenging has been the responsiveness as I am still a bit unsure about how to make flexbox work the way I want it to, something to practice on.
I chose to change the color scheme a bit but it still has a good contrast. 

Also need to learn more about accessbility.
